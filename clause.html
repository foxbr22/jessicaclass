        <h2>Part 1: Understanding Relative Clauses</h2>
        
        <p>Relative clauses are subordinate clauses that provide additional information about a noun or pronoun in the main clause. They are introduced by relative pronouns (who, whom, whose, which, that).</p>

            <p style="margin-top:0;"><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-bottom:0;">
                <li>"That" can replace "who," "whom," and "which" in defining relative clauses only</li>
                <li>"That" cannot replace "whose" - there is no possessive form of "that"</li>
                <li>"That" cannot be used in non-defining relative clauses (clauses with commas)</li>
                <li>In informal spoken English, "who" is often used instead of "whom"</li>
                <li>In informal English, the relative pronoun is sometimes omitted when it's the object of the verb (e.g., "The book I read" instead of "The book that/which I read")</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Rule 1: Defining Relative Clauses (Restrictive)</h3>
            <p>Defining relative clauses provide essential information that identifies which person or thing we are talking about. They are <span class="bold">not separated by commas</span>.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p>1. The book <span class="highlight">that I borrowed from the library</span> is overdue.</p>
                <p>2. The woman <span class="highlight">who called earlier</span> wants to speak to you.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Rule 2: Non-defining Relative Clauses (Non-restrictive)</h3>
            <p>Non-defining relative clauses provide additional, non-essential information and are <span class="bold">separated by commas</span>. We cannot use "that" in non-defining clauses.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p>1. My brother, <span class="highlight">who lives in Australia</span>, is visiting next month.</p>
                <p>2. Paris, <span class="highlight">which is the capital of France</span>, is famous for its architecture.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Rule 3: "Who" for People</h3>
            <p>Use "who" to refer to people (as the subject of the relative clause).</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p>1. The teacher <span class="highlight">who teaches math</span> is very popular.</p>
                <p>2. Anyone <span class="highlight">who wants to join</span> should sign up by Friday.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Rule 4: "Whom" for People (Objects)</h3>
            <p>Use "whom" to refer to people when they are the object of the verb in the relative clause. "Who" is often used in spoken English instead of "whom".</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p>1. The candidate <span class="highlight">whom we selected</span> declined the offer.</p>
                <p>2. The students <span class="highlight">whom you met yesterday</span> are in my class.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Rule 5: "Which" for Things</h3>
            <p>Use "which" to refer to things and animals (in both defining and non-defining clauses).</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p>1. The car <span class="highlight">which broke down</span> has been repaired.</p>
                <p>2. The movie, <span class="highlight">which won several awards</span>, was based on a true story.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Rule 6: "That" for People and Things (Defining Only)</h3>
            <p>Use "that" to refer to both people and things in defining relative clauses only. "That" cannot be used in non-defining clauses.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p>1. The phone <span class="highlight">that I bought last week</span> is already broken.</p>
                <p>2. The people <span class="highlight">that work here</span> are very friendly.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Rule 7: "Whose" for Possession</h3>
            <p>Use "whose" to show possession for both people and things.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p>1. The student <span class="highlight">whose paper won the competition</span> received a scholarship.</p>
                <p>2. I live in a building <span class="highlight">whose roof was damaged</span> in the storm.</p>
